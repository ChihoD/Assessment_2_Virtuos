# Welcome to Virtuos a Virtual Reality Training Program

## Personal Information

### Elliott Morton
My name is Elliott Morton, I’m currently studying an Introduction to Information Technology at RMIT, and my student number is s3795102. My hobbies include; Virtual Reality gaming, Cricket, Travelling and watching the beautiful game that is Football aka soccer. At the end of my studies I’d love to work in either sports statistics and analytics or Game Design specifically for Virtual Reality, to achieve either of these jobs in the future I will have to complete a Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology and also a Graduate Certificate in Sports Analytics.

### Duc Tran
My name is Duc Tran (student I.D s3807447) and currently I am doing 3 subjects which are user-centred design, introduction to programming and introduction to information and technology. Outside of I.T I am currently working at a bakery, like to exercise, watch anime and collect rocks. I hope to one day work somewhere in the data analytics field but I am still open to other options. My interest in I.T began when I was little through my oldest brother who at the time was working for IBM. I was always interested in what he was doing both hardware and software wise. As the years progressed I started to delve more into programming such as making a website in year 10 using Microsoft Front Page and then moving on to java coding using C++, using Microsoft SQL for making databases, using Python and finally to Eclipse. The team I am a part of is named Virtuous.

## Team Profile

### Duc's Test Results

### Elliott's Test Results
When taking the results of figures 2 to 7 and Chiho’s tests into account when forming a team, these results tells us what the personality of each member is like and what their method of learning is, and so would help us understand how each member of the team is like from their personality to their preference of learning style. From knowing this, this could potentially help us form a team that is more understanding of each other and help us work together better. For example, if all members have a strong desire to do well in their given tasks then overall the team has a higher probability of obtaining higher marks for the project.

### Chiho's Test Results
Chiho underwent three tests which were the Myers-Briggs test, the online learning test and the DISC (Dominance Influence Steadiness and Conscientiousness) test. Her Myers-Briggs test result came back as Introverted Sensing Feeling Perceiving (ISFP-T) (Yamagishi 2019). The result of her learning style test revealed that she was a visual type of learner and lastly her DIS personality test results revealed that she was conscientious, diligent and has attention to detail (Yamagishi 2019).

## Ideal Jobs
The ideal job for Duc would be as a data analyst, Chiho’s ideal job would be as a financial advisor and Elliot’s ideal job would be as a sports performance analyst. These jobs are all jobs that require analytical skills in order to identify the problem and solve it. As a data analyst we would need to figure out and look thoroughly at the raw data and translate that into a format that is understandable by key stakeholders. As a financial advisor we would need to analyse the client’s situation, plan and research the best way to make use of the available finances to them. Finally as a sports performance analyst we would need to analyse the athlete’s performance and formulate a plan that they can follow to better improve themselves.

Each of our dream jobs differ from each other by the fact that they are in different job fields although as a data analyst I could be working with clients from both Chiho’s and Elliot’s field. Chiho’s dream job would be more in the finance field, Elliot’s dream job would be in the sports field and my dream job would be in the statistical and data processing field. Each field would have a different emphasise on the skill sets one must have to work in the job and the types of clients one will meet in their job.

## Tools

## Industry Data
The job title for my dream job would be called a data analyst, Chiho’s dream job would fall under personal financial advisor 1 or personal financial advisor 2 (senior), whilst Elliot’s dream job would fall under the title of sports analyst. According to a job report conducted by Hays ( a job recruitment company), one of the jobs in most demand following the next 6 months in 2019 would be for data analysts in the information technology field (news.com.au 2019).

According to Level Data Analytics Team (2019), the must have skills a data analyst must have is that they have an understanding of how to use SQL (structured query language), must be able to use Microsoft Excel, must be a critical thinker, be able to use programs that use statistical programming languages (such as Python or R), must be able to visualise data and interpret it in a way everyone can understand, have good presentation skills and as a bonus have experience or knowledge in machine

learning or predictive modelling as these are techniques have recently been developed for better statistical accuracy.

According to Burning Glass’ (2018) top 25 skills that were most in demand by employers (I.T related) within the data analyst job, knowing how to use SQL was at the top of the list, being able to use Microsoft Excel fell under being able to use Microsoft Office products which ranked 17th on the demand list and being able to use programs such as Python was ranked 22nd on the list.

Non-I.T skills wise within the data analyst job, Burning Glass’s (2018 file:///C:/Users/Duc/Downloads/Top%20Generic%20Skills%20March%202018.pdf) data shows that critical thinking (which would fall under creativity and analytical skills) is rated 9th and 17th respectively, data visualisation (which falls under articulate) is ranked 23rd, presentation is ranked 14th and having knowledge of machine learning techniques or predictive modelling was not on the ranking list as it is a bonus skill set to have.

Having looked at the Burning Glass data my opinion of a data analyst has not changed due to the fact that I was aware already that these kind of skill sets are needed. Although I would still need to learn further, my fundamental knowledge of SQL, Python, Excel, experience of doing presentations and my analytical nature, in my opinion, has put me on a good path into preparing for my dream job.
